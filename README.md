# Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity

In this challenge I created a web page using JavaScript and Plotly that showed a bar chart, bubble graph and gauge that showed which user washed their belly button the most. I created a drop-down menu that would allow the user to click on an ID that would render the page and give new charts/data.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
